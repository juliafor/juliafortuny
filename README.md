I’m a data analyst based in Berlin. 

Working with data fuels my natural curiosity and drilling down to find answers gives me the kicks. 
Even more so, when it forces me to think out of the box. 

For example, in one of my projects, I found that the most expensive items are bought at 5am. Why?  

I believe that what can be measured can be changed- and this applies not only to businesses but also to the social and environmental situations we find ourselves in, to which I’m increasingly inclined to offer my services. 

Contact me for full- or part-time positions in Berlin or remote, or if you just want to get in touch!
