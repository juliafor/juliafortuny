<h1>About me </h1>
I’m a data analyst based in Berlin. 

I graduated from the CareerFoundry Data Immersion course in October 2021 and I'm currently looking for my first job in the field. 

I have 8+ years experience as a concert tour manager and a background in customer service in retail and hotels. As a tour manager, my target was to seek the highest impact while ensuring the cost efficiency of a project. Analysing audience data is essential for reaching such a goal. I turned to quantitative data analytics to deepen my understanding of user behaviour and plan projects based on insights, with the aim to increase their effectiveness and impact.

I am fascinated by the way in which data can show general trends but also address specific questions. Working with data fuels my natural curiosity and drilling down to find answers gives me the kicks. Even more so, when it forces me to think out of the box. 

For example, in one of my projects, I found that the most expensive items are bought at 5 am. Why?  

I believe that what can be measured can be changed- and this applies not only to businesses but also to the social and environmental situations we find ourselves in, to which I’m increasingly inclined to offer my services. 

I particularly enjoy working with Python and would like to continue developing in that direction. 

I speak and write English, German, Spanish, Catalan and French, and Chinese to level B2.
I’m currently looking for a full- or part time position as a junior analyst in Berlin or remote.
